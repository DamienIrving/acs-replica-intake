title: Frequent Rainfall Observations on GridS (FROGS) database 
description: |
    Replica of the Frequent Rainfall Observations on GridS (FROGS) database.
    FROGs is a collection of daily precipitation products on a common 1×1 deg grid. The collection includes satellite, ground-based and reanalysis products.
    The temporal range included starts from 1901 to 2019 depending on the data product.

# Python regular expression to decompose the DRS
#   Name a section with (?P<NAME>...)
#   Refer to a previous name with (?P=NAME) (e.g. if the variable is in both the path and filename)
#   Uses the re.VERBOSE flag, comments allowed
#   NB: the last bit of the regex should work as
#   /(?P<date>(?!.*\b.nc\b).+)
#   however when run on its own on the test_drs code it worked 
#   and "\b" where converted to "\x08", while it failed with ingest.py
#   where "\b" remained the same
