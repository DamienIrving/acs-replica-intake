title: Global Precipitation Climatology Centre monthly and daily gridded precipitation
description: |
    Replica of the full reanalysis of GPCC gridded gauge-analysis products derived from quality controlled station data. The latest version is V2022 monthly and daily covering from 1891 to 2020. The data is available on 4 global grids (0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.5 degrees) for monthly and only at 1.0  degrees resolution for daily. |
    The data is not bias-corrected for gauges errors, but estimates on these are also provided.
