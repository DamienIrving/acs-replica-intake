title: Climate extreme indices and heat stress indicators derived from CMIP6 global climate projections dataset
description: |
        Replica of the CMAP precipitation including monthly and pentad global gridded precipitation means. It has a standard version (std) and one enhanced (enh) with NCEP Reanalysis. CMAP covers from 1979 to near the present on a global grid at 2.5 degree latitude x 2.5 degree longitude resolution.
            The original data is ascii, this is a netcdf version from the Physical Sciences Laboratory (PSL).
