title: NOAA CPC MORPHing technique Climate Data Record v1.0 
description: |
    This data set is for the bias-corrected, reprocessed CPC Morphing technique (CMORPH) high-resolution global satellite precipitation estimates. 
    The bias corrected CMORPH satellite precipitation estimates are created on an 8 km by 8 km grid over the global domain from 60 degrees S to 60 degrees N and in a 30-minute interval from January 1998 to present. Due to the delay of some input data sets, this formal version (Version 1) bias corrected CMORPH is produced manually once a month at a latency of 3-4 months.
