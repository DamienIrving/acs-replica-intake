            Replica of the Climate extreme indices and heat stress indicators derived from CMIP6 global climate projections dataset (CICERO_ETCCDI) from the Copernicus Climate Datastore on gadi. This collection is a copy of CICERO_ETCCDI, which includes climate indices calculated on CMIP6 models historical and projections experiments. The collection includes ETCCDI (climate extrems indices) at yearly and monthly resolution, and HSI (Heat Stress Indicators) at daily resolution.
            This dataset is part of the Australian Community Reference Climate Data Collection at NCI.
            The files were downloaded from the CDS as netcdf files and compressed using nccopy.

            Replica of the full reanalysis of GPCC gridded gauge-analysis products derived from quality controlled station data. The latest version is V2022 monthly and daily covering from 1891 to 2020. The data is available on 4 global grids (0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.5 degrees) for monthly and only at 1.0  degrees resolution for daily. |
            The data is not bias-corrected for gauges errors, but estimates on these are also provided.

            Replica of the CMAP precipitation including monthly and pentad global gridded precipitation means. It has a standard version (std) and one enhanced (enh) with NCEP Reanalysis. CMAP covers from 1979 to near the present on a global grid at 2.5 degree latitude x 2.5 degree longitude resolution.
            The original data is ascii, this is a netcdf version from the Physical Sciences Laboratory (PSL).
